# PublicTransportationSQL

## üöÜ Project Overview

This project simulates a **city public transportation system** using a MySQL database. It allows tracking of:  

- **Routes** and their corresponding **stations**  
- **Vehicles** and **drivers**  
- **Schedules** for departures and arrivals  
- **Passengers** and **tickets**  

The goal is to showcase **SQL skills** in database design, data insertion, queries, and analytics, while solving real-world transit management problems.

## üóÇ Database Schema / ER Diagram

The database is organized into the following tables:

1. **Routes** ‚Äì Contains route details including start & end points, distance, and route name.  
2. **Stations** ‚Äì Lists all stations in the transit network.  
3. **RouteStations** ‚Äì Links stations to routes with a specific stop order.  
4. **Vehicles** ‚Äì Stores vehicles assigned to routes, including type and capacity.  
5. **Drivers** ‚Äì Information about drivers and the vehicles they are assigned to.  
6. **Schedules** ‚Äì Departure and arrival times of vehicles on routes.  
7. **Passengers** ‚Äì Stores passenger information such as name, email, and phone.  
8. **Tickets** ‚Äì Tracks ticket purchases, fares, and payment status.  

**ER Diagram:**  
You can generate a visual ER diagram in **MySQL Workbench** or use **draw.io**. Save it in the `screenshots/` folder for reference.

## üîç Sample Queries

The project includes **professional SQL queries** demonstrating real-world analytics:

1. **Busiest Route** ‚Äì Count tickets sold per route:

```sql
SELECT r.route_name, COUNT(t.ticket_id) AS tickets_sold
FROM Tickets t
JOIN Schedules s ON t.schedule_id = s.schedule_id
JOIN Routes r ON s.route_id = r.route_id
GROUP BY r.route_name
ORDER BY tickets_sold DESC;
